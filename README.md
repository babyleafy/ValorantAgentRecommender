# Valorant Agent Recommender
A third party VALORANT app built with Python and Selenium, retrieves and analyzes data from major esports sites to make agent recommendations to players based on professional compositions. 

## Instructions for Use
[Fill] Select a map, region, and up to four agents. Click the Fill button and the app will return the most meta agent composition seen in pro play (based on times chosen in tournaments). Use the [Clear] button to clear the agent pool.

[Full] Select a map and use the search bar to search a team. Teams can be from the listbox or any arbitrary team the user inputs. When a desired team is typed in, click the Full button and the app will return the most recent agent composition that the desired team has played on the specified map. Use the [Clear] button to reset the Full button and clear the search bar.
